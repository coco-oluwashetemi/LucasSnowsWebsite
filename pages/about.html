                <h1>How It All Begain</h1>
                <p>
                    Snow Trails was founded in 1965 with a simple vision: to bring together people who love the magic of
                    winter. What began as a grassroots effort — a few friends carving trails and sharing their passion —
                    quickly grew into a dedicated agency for winter enthusiasts.
                </p>

                <p>
                    By the late 1970s, we had expanded beyond slopes, offering guided tours, training programs, and
                    curated winter experiences that connected adventurers with the season in new ways. The 1980s and
                    1990s marked our transformation into a true company: we built partnerships with resorts, launched
                    specialized programs for families and athletes, and introduced events that celebrated the culture of
                    snow sports.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Entering the 2000s, Snow Trails embraced innovation, investing in modern equipment, professional
                    coaching, and sustainable practices to ensure winter adventures could thrive for generations. By
                    2010, we had become more than a ski area — we were a trusted agency, hosting winter festivals,
                    torchlight parades, and family traditions passed down through generations.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Today, after more than half a century, Snow Trails stands as a global hub for winter enthusiasts — a
                    place where history, expertise, and passion come together to craft unforgettable experiences in the
                    snow.
